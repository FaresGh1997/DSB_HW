Solve various business tasks by applying Data Science and Mathematical Statistics

This repo demonstrates multiple statistical and Data analysis techniques to solve business tasks including:
- Business Classification: statical descriptive analysis, one-hit encoding and K-neighbors Classifier on [spaceship titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic)
- Business Regression: Data Manipulation and Visualization on Transaction dataset for ecommerce business, then preform regression on total Transaction revenue.
- Business Prediction: study the effect of discount strategies on customer attrition, by using binary classification models to predict if the customer will churn or not with the discount strategies applied.
- Marketing campaign comparison: statistical study of effect of 3 marketing campaigns on different markets using student-t test and confidence intervals.
